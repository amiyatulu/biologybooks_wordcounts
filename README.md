#Word counts of different books for analysis

### OpenStax Biology, Campbell Biology, NCERT Biology


Important word rank with count in different books  

Campbell Biology:  
Rank 1: figure; 5088  
Rank 15: concept; 1997  
Rank 18: how;1759  
Rank 43: data;1072  
Rank 46: evolution;1066  
Rank 50: structure;929  
Rank 81: evolutionary;692  
Rank 258: structures;375  

structure [structure+structures] count is around 1304, should be ranked in the top 30.  
evolution [evolution+evolutionary] count is around 1758, should be ranked in top 20.  


OpenStax Biology  
Rank 3: figure;2640  
Rank 24: membrane;721  
Rank 25: structure;709  
Rank 27: how; 682  
Rank 34: example;631  
Rank 90: evolution;380  
Rank 134: structures;301  
Rank 222: evolutionary:226  
Rank 258: data; 204  
Rank 327: examples; 177  
evolution [evolution+evolutionary] count is around 606, should be ranked in top 40.  
structure [structure+structures] count is around 1010, should be ranked in the top 10.  


NCERT Biology (11th and 12th Class)  
Rank 3 figure;823  
Rank 35 how;239  
Rank 37 membrane;227  
Rank 40 structure;219  
Rank 70 example;154  
Rank 144 structures;108  
Rank 165 evolution;99  
Rank 193 examples;90  

structure [structure+structures] count is around 327 should be ranked in the top 20.    

Conclusion:  
Instances of data are maximum in Campbell Biology. Most thing in the book is explained with giving real world experimental data.  
Both Campbell Biology and OpenStak Biology stress biology in the purview of evolution with maximum examples and emphasizing on structures in biology as form follows function, along with answer maximum probing questions (as how ranks much higher)  

NCERT biology lacks emphasis of all these concepts. Even though figures tops in NCERT biology, but in many chapters, relevant figures of textual content is missing.
